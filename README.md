This repo contains declarative configuration for:
- my [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) computers, under `hosts/`
- [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) based rice for desktop machines, under `home/`
- devices on my home network - DHCP, DNS, etc., in `devices.nix`
- IoT smart home devices firmware using [ESPHome](https://esphome.io), under `esphome-hosts/`
- some things I packaged with nix that the above uses, under `pkgs/`
- custom NixOS/flake-parts modules that enable the whole thing to exist, under `modules/`

*If you really want to understand what this is about, check out the [AI generated documentation on DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/akosnad/nix-config).
It did a pretty good job of understanding the repo. Some things are overly verbose and repetitive, but only a couple of small details were left out, like how are ESPHome devices updated.*

## Device topology

Here is a diagram that explains what this mess is about better than I did above.
